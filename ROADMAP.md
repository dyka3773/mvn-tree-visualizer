## Release Strategy

Each release follows this approach:
- **Incremental Value:** Each version adds meaningful value without breaking existing functionality
- **User-Driven:** Priority based on user feedback and common pain points
- **Quality First:** New features include comprehensive tests and documentation
- **Backward Compatibility:** CLI interface remains stable across minor versions
